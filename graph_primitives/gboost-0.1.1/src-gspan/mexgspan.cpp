/* mexgspan.cpp - MEX interface to Taku Kudo's gspan implementation and
 *    additionally gspan for graph boosting.
 *
 * Author: Sebastian Nowozin <sebastian.nowozin@tuebingen.mpg.de>
 * Date: 31st August 2006
 *
 * Usage for gspan frequent subgraph mining:
 *
 * [graphs, count] = mexgspan (G, minsup, size_req, directed);
 *
 * or for graph boosting
 *
 * [graphs, ybase, GY] = mexgspan (G, minsup, size_req, directed,
 *    boostY, boostWeights, boostTau, boostN, boostMax, boostType);
 *
 * Find all subgraphs in the set of graphs G that appear at least minsup
 * times.  Return at most maxpat patterns.
 *
 ***
 * Input
 *
 * G: (1,n) cellarray of n graph structures with this layout
 *    g.nodelabels: (n,1) discrete integer labels [L_1 ; L_2 ; ... ; L_n];
 *    g.edges: (m,2) edges, [from to] at each line:
 *       [e_1_{from} e_1_{to} edgelabel_1 ; ... ; e_m_{from} e_m_{to} edgelabel_m]
 *       The node indices go from 1 to n.
 * minsup: The minimum number of times a frequent pattern has to appear in G.
 * size_req: (1,2) real vector containing lower/upper bounds on graph size.
 *    Use [0 0] for no limit, [n 0] for a lower bound, [0 n] for an upper bound.
 * directed: 1 in case the graphs are directed, 0 in case of undirected.
 *    Undirected graphs are working, directed graphs return the wrong number
 *    of substructes(?).
 *
 * (optional, only necessary for graph boosting)
 *
 * boostY: (n,1) array of labels in {-1, 1}.
 * boostWeights: (n,1) array of reals in [0 ; 1].
 * boostTau: tau parameter (normally set to 0).
 * boostN: integer > 0.  From the best patterns, only the best boostN patterns
 *    are returned.
 * boostMax: The maximum number of exploration steps to take or zero for
 *    infinity (1e6 is a good choice here).
 * boostType: 1 for 1-class and 1.5-class boosting, 2 for 2-class boosting.
 *
 ***
 * Output
 *
 * For normal frequent subgraph mining:
 *
 * graphs: (1,p) cellarray of p graph structures that appear frequently in G.
 * count: (1,p) uint32 array giving at element i the number of times graphs{i}
 *    appears in G (duplicates within one graph only counted once).
 *
 * For boosting:
 *
 * graphs: (1,p) cellarray of p graph structures that are discriminative in G.
 * ybase: (1,p) integers in {-1, 1} for 2-class boosting, {1} for 1-class.
 * GY: (n,p) response matrix
